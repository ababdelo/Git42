- **User Management**: Easily add, remove, edit, and list users from a central database.
- **Multiple Profiles**: Store and manage multiple Git user profiles, each with its own SSH key.
- **Seamless Switching**: Switch between GitHub accounts instantly using a single command.
- **Automated SSH Key Handling**: Simplify authentication by automating SSH key management.
- **Interactive CLI**: Enjoy an intuitive, user-friendly command-line interface for configuration and operations.

## Prerequisites

Before using Git42, ensure you have:

- **Bash Shell**: Available on Linux, macOS, or Git Bash for Windows.
- **Git**: Confirm your installation with `git --version`.
- 

## Installation

Install Git42 automatically by running:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ababdelo/Git42/main/install.sh)
```

## Usage

### Adding a New User

To add a new Git user profile, execute the following command:

```bash
git42 add
```

You will be prompted to enter:

- Git username
- Git email
- SSH key path

Once entered, this userâ€™s information is saved, and you can switch to them without re-entering these details in the future.

### Removing a 

To delete a user profile, use the following command:

```bash
git42 rm <user_id>
```

This will permanently remove the specified user from the database.

### Editing a User

To modify a userâ€™s details, such as username, email, or SSH key, run:

```bash
git42 edit <user_id>
```

### Listing Users

To view all registered users and their details, execute:

```bash
git42 list
```

### Switching to a User

To switch to a different user profile, use:

```bash
git42 setup <user_id>
```

This command:

1. Clears all currently added SSH keys.
2. Adds the selected user's SSH key to the SSH agent.
3. Update the global Git configuration to reflect the chosen userâ€™s details.

### Updating Configuration

To adjust Git42â€™s configuration settings, run:

```bash
git42 config 
```

You will be prompted to select an option from the available choices, such as:

- user_db <path/to/new_database>

Note: This feature is still in beta and currently only supports updating the database location.

## Example Workflow

1. Add two users:
   ```bash
    git42 add
    # Enter details for the first user
    git42 add
    # Enter details for the second user
   ```
2. Switch between accounts:
   ```bash
    git42 setup user1
    # Work under the first account (e.g., clone a repository, make changes, commit, and push).

    git42 setup user2
    # Work under the second account (e.g., clone a repository, make changes, commit, and push).

   ```
3. Remove a user:
   ```bash
   git42 rm user1
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- **SSH key fails to add**: Ensure the SSH agent is running: `eval \$(ssh-agent -s)`.
- **Cannot find a user**: Run `git42 list` to check stored users.
- **Git credentials incorrect**: Run `git config --global --list` to verify the applied settings.
